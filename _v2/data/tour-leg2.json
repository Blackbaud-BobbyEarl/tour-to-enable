Sure, there may not be any rides here, but you are still given the awesome ability to pin trade, shop, and eat a ton of snacks. I think it's safe to say that I've honestly had days where I've had a ton more fun hanging around in Downtown Disney than I did in a park. \n\nIf you're looking for souvenirs to take home with you, this is definitely the place to get them. All of the merchandise in the shops here still have those crazy Disney price tags. However, there are a ton of different stores in Downtown Disney which make it easy to get souvenirs for everybody all in one place. Plus, you won't be forced to carry around a ton of shopping bags during a day in the parks. \n\nIf you're looking for a relaxing day off from Magic Kingdom, I definitely suggest you head to Downtown Disney for some Earl of Sandwich and a movie. It's honestly one of my absolute favorite things to do when I take a trip to WDW. Just be sure to bring a little extra cash with you; Earl of Sandwich is cheap, but the movie theater most definitely is not.","author_id":1938452,"author_name":"Melissa","author_username":"RUNMYDEAR","author_avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/856e6d94243f862bcac74a72f45482ef?d=https%3A%2F%2Froadtrippers.com%2Fassets%2Fusers%2F0%2Fdefault-user-50.png&s=50","author_avatar_big":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/856e6d94243f862bcac74a72f45482ef?d=https%3A%2F%2Froadtrippers.com%2Fassets%2Fusers%2F0%2Fdefault-user-150.png&s=150","author_guide":null,"author_trusted":false,"author_badge":null,"created_at":"2015-07-06T16:36:39Z","created_at_ago":"about 1 month ago"},{"id":36767,"text":"World-class restaurants, dazzling entertainment and unique shops line the waterfront at Downtown Disney area.
