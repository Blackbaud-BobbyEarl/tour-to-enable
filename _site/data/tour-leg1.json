The rooms in the rendezvous tower are great, spacious and clean. They have a nice view of the the ocean and sometimes you can get a good view of the Steel Pier. I litterally wont stay anywhere else.\n\nThe casino is fun, and they have plenty of different games to play.  They seem to update their slots fairly often.  I always find something new when i vist.  Most recently they added a food court.  Which I didnt know they where missing untill they actually finished it.  Now I dont know how they went without it.

We ordered a house special, and it was quite yummy. Plus, the menu was diverse and they served locally brewed beer on the menu. The surrounding town looked very nice, as well, in case you want to walk off all that pizza.

Hard work, family effort and a \"secret recipe\" contributed to the long run success of Mystic Pizza. Of course, the real reason behind our success is our pizza.

Ms. Jones chose Mystic Pizza as the focus and setting for her story of the lives and loves of three young waitresses. The movie was filmed on location in Mystic and neighboring towns. \"Mystic Pizza\" was released in 1988 and was a hit, even Siskel and Ebert gave it two thumbs up!Â Meanwhile, back in Mystic... the little pizza shop could barely keep up the demand. Customers lined the sidewalk, waiting to taste \"A Slice of Heaven.\" Menus and matchbooks disappeared in amazing quantities. Cars on Main Street dangerously avoided pizza fans who straddled the yellow lines angling for photos. What could we do? We answered the hungry demand and opened Mystic Pizza II in North Stonington.Â This shop thrives, but it still isn't enough to satisfy nationwide pizza
